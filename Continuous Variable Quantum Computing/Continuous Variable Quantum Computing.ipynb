    "# Continuous Variable Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous-variable (CV) quantum information is the area of quantum information science that makes use of physical observables, like the strength of an electromagnetic field, whose numerical values belong to continuous intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically in CV instead of each qubit there is quantum harmonic oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single qumode\n",
    "Quantum harmonic oscillator is, as well as classical one, a model of particle moving in quadratic potential, but with consideration of quantum effect, which occurs at very low energies.\n",
    "So full system energy (Hamiltonian) is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{H}=\\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2}+\\frac{\\hat{x}^2}{2}=-\\hbar^2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{~d} x^2}+\\frac{x^2}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\hat{p}$ is momentum operator, $\\hat{x}$ -- position operator and mass of the particle is assumed to be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example particle can not be in specific point of space, but instead is described by probability of being in different points and has minimal uncertainty in position. That's why particle can't be in zero point with zero energy, but instead has a ground state with minimal but positive energy. This state is called vacuum state and can be visualized as a standard gaussian with zero mean and unit standard deviation.\n",

    "On the picture above you can see quasi-probability distribution. Horizontal axes are $\\hat{p}$ and $\\hat{x}$ quadratures, and vertical axis is quasi-probability. \"Quasi\" here means that in some regions is can be negative, and for some states it can be not a function at all (in the same sense as $\\delta$-function is not a function). Negativity of Wigner function is equivalent to quantum contextuality (Booth, Chabaud, and Emeriau 2022). But it is connected to normal probability function by property, that marginal probabilities are probabilities of getting corresponding quadrature (up to $1/2$ factor)\n",

    "But they are more difficult to work with on quantum device. Also their simulation is more computationally expensive. To simulate gaussian operations, matrix multiplications with $n\\times n$ covariance matrix and $1\\times n$ means vector is enough, while exact simulation of general operations is impossible. Each qumode has countable basis, so simulators are limited to a few lowest basis states and track amplitudes of corresponding states. And still computational complexity for such approximate simulation scales as $k^n$, where $k$ is number of tracked basis states, and $n$ - number of qumodes, while discrete quantum computing simulation scales like $2^n$.\n",
