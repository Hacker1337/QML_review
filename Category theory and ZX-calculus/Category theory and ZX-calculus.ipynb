    "# Category theory and ZX-calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "Category theory is very high level abstract of mathematics, that study mathematical structures and their relations. Although it's very abstract, it's high level of generalization thing allowed to describe objects from different scientific field in a unified terms of closed symmetric monoidal categories. Namely analogies can be shown between physics, topology, logic and computation (Baez and Stay 2011). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of ability to naturally describe quantum mechanics in terms of monoidal categories, there are attempts to introduce to quantum physicists society diagrammatic language for describing quantum circuits (Coecke 2008; 2005). It is argued, that the formalism currently used in quantum mechanics is very suboptimal, since simple identical transformations of the phenomenon recorded by this formalism can be completely non-obvious and indistinct. While with the help of diagrams it becomes clear and obvious.\n",

    "Different variations of diagrammatic representation of quantum teleportation protocol at different times by Bob Coecke\n",
    "\n",

    "Circuit representation of teleportation protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Such circuits are also a for of graphical representation of quantum protocol, so it has previously discussed benefits. But it is better, because it is closer to real implementation, while diagrammatic language hides some important details. For example measurements and exchange of results as a classical information between Alice and Bob are obvious in classical circuit, it is hidden in diagrammatic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although diagrammatic representation of circuits didn't change quantum physicist's routine, it's further development -- ZX-calculus has found it's niche. For introduction to ZX-calculus see for example (van de Wetering 2020).\n",

    "ZX-calculus is build on two simple one-qubit gates (Z and X Pauli rotations) and their multiqubit's generalization which is called spiders. \n",

    "And another beautiful property of ZX-calculus -- it doesn't matter how you move this spiders, there is no difference between input and output, so CNOT can be represented as simply two connected in any way(see picture below). And it looks pretty similar to commonly used CNOT representation (last picture in the figure)\n",

    "There are many publications using ZX-calculus. They are collected at this website https://zxcalculus.com/publications.html . Most practical applications are quantum circuits optimization (Kissinger and van de Wetering 2020) and graph states for measurement based quantum computing representation (Kissinger and van de Wetering 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any circuit can be represented with ZX-calculus, but at the same time general 'spider' doesn't have a physical representation or analog in common circuit language. So not any ZX-circuit is represented by some normal circuit. This gives additional freedom, which helps in circuit optimization task.\n",
    "Also as there are only few basic elements in ZX-calculus (in contrast to many different redundant circuit gates) number of rules for transforming ZX-calculus circuits is less than 10, which also very convenient for automated circuits optimization. \n",
    "It is claimed by Bob Coecke that because of simplicity of these set of rules, people should be learned ZX-calculus instead of regular gates. But because of simplicity of base elements of zx calculus, lot's of spiders can be required to construct a simple practically useful gate. For computer it is not a problem, but for human being it is inconvenient and provokes mistakes.\n",
