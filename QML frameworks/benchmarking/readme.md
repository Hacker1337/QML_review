## QML benchmarking

Benchmarks can be run using jupyter notebooks `pennylane_test.ipynb` and `tf_quantum_test.ipynb`.
Results will be saved to csv files.

Visualization is available in aggregate_and_plot.ipynb notebook

The task for performance comparing is counting gradients in quantum circuits with different number of qubits.
