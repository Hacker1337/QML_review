Code to learn QuGAN model from (Stein et al. 2021).

Code can be run as a py file and configured with command line arguments, or as a jupyter notebook.

There are 3 available models, that can be chosen by `model` parameter:\
"c" -- classial GAN \
"q_exp" -- expectation value base quantum model with classical noise \
"q_sample" -- quantum sample based model. Uses quantum randomness
