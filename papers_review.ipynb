    "\n",
    "All subgraphs quantum graph model for graph classification was introduced in paper \"Graph kernels encoding features of all subgraphs by quantum superposition\" (Kishi et al. 2022). \n",
    "The model is kernel based. It embeds graph into state vector in hilbert space, and than classification is done using standard [SVM kernel trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine). The kernel is just Gram matrix of embeddings in hilbert space. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to embed simple properties of a subgraph, like number of vertices or number of edges, into quantum state. Due to properties of quantum computer, qubits can store instantly such information about every subgraph of the embedded graph in the form of superposition.\n",
    "And furthermore, due to linearity of quantum operators this embedding can be evaluated in parallel for all subgraphs. \n",
    "This is called the quantum oracle and this technic is widely used in famous quantum algorithms. In Shor algorithm quantum parallelism is used to raise the same number in multiple powers encoded in superposition to get superposition of the results.\n",
    "$$|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle + |2\\rangle + ... → |a^0\\rangle + |a^1\\rangle + |a^2\\rangle + ...  $$    \n",
    "Likewise in this algorithm exponential speedup is achieved, as computations are done instantly for all $2^{\\#Edges}$ possible subgraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such embedding big scalar product will mean, that graphs have many pairs of subgraphs with the same properties.\n",

    "This graph model was proposed by Xanadu company in (Schuld et al. 2020).\n",
    "Gaussian boson sampling is an analog of the boson sampling circuit, but for optical, or so called continuous variable quantum platform. Boson sampling is mostly famous for being one of the first circuits to demonstrate quantum advantage  (Arute et al. 2019). And it wasn't intended to do something practically useful.\n",

    "Gaussian boson sampling circuit consist of the input, which is squeezing and displacing of gaussian's states. Then there is constant beam splitters part. And finally in the end numbers of detected photons for each channel is counted ($n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$, ...)\n",

    "\n",
    "In case of applying GBS for graphs more interesting is case, when C is graph adjacency matrix. This lead to more simple interpretation of hafnian as a number of perfect matchings in the graph G. \n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect matching is a subset of edges such that every node is covered by exactly one of the edges. The Hafnian therefore sums the products of the edge weights in all perfect matchings. If all edge weights are constant, it simply counts the number of perfect matchings in G.\n",
