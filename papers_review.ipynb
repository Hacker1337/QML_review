    "# QML frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two most popular frameworks for quantum machine learning: pennylane (Bergholm et al. 2022) by Xanadu and TensorFlow Quantum (Broughton et al. 2021) from Google. There is also popular qiskit (Aleksandrowicz et al. 2019) framework from IBM, designed more for general quantum computing than for quantum machine learning, but it can also be used for ML (see for example [qiskit QML tutorials](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/machine-learning/tutorials/index.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general these frameworks provide:\n",
    "- interface for defining quantum circuits\n",
    "- classical simulators of quantum circuits for easy small scale noiseless experiments\n",
    "- interface for running circuits on real quantum hardware by different providers\n",
    "- interface for seamless integration with classical machine learning frameworks (Pytorch and Tensorflow), which allow:\n",
    "  - integration of quantum models to existing ML pipelines\n",
    "  - constructing hybrid quantum/classical model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for fast circuit result prediction, ML tasks usually require efficient ways of gradients estimating. There are several popular derivative counting algorithms suitable for simulation or for real quantum hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finite difference\n",
    "This is the simples default technic available both in simulation and on hardware. Works pretty bed with sampling based methods due to significant noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\theta_i}\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta_i}(\\hat{B}) = \\frac{[\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta_i + d\\theta}(\\hat{B}) - \\mathcal{M}_{\\theta_i}(\\hat{B})]}{d\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} f(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{d\\alpha} \\cdot \\left( f\\left(\\alpha + d\\alpha\\right) -  f\\left(\\alpha \\right) \\right)  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter shift\n",
    "Parameter shifting rule is much more noise resistent technic compatible with sampling. \n",
    "It was first introduced to quantum machine learning in [Mitarai et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00745 \"‌\"), and extended in [Schuld et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11184 \"‌\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In these works it was proved, that for any one qubit gate such a wonder full property is fulfilled. For these gates exist finite constants $с$ and $s$ that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\theta_i}\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta_i}(\\hat{B}) = c[\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta_i + s}(\\hat{B}) - \\mathcal{M}_{\\theta_i - s}(\\hat{B})],$$\n",
    "which means that infinitely small difference can be replaced with some specific big difference, but equality will still hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example for PauliY gate \\\n",
    "$|\\alpha⟩ = Y^{\\alpha}|0⟩$ \\\n",
    "$f(\\alpha) = ⟨\\alpha|X|\\alpha⟩$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} f(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} f\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) -  \\frac{ \\pi}{2} f\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation technics\n",
    "Since simulators play important role in research process, tricks that improve algorithm running speed only in simulation were also developed, although they will loose their significance in post NISQ era.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjoint method\n",
    "Detailed tutorial with theory explanations can be found in [demo](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_adjoint_diff.html) from pennyLane.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in a nutshell this method accelerate gradient evaluation by exploiting reversibility of quantum operations. While inverse matrix computation in general is relatively slow, for unitary matrix representing quantum operations by definition inverse equals to adjoint (transposition + complex conjugate) with is almost computationally free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering this, algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle M \\rangle = \\langle b | k \\rangle = \\langle \\Psi | M | \\Psi \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly decompose the expectation into the scalar product of two vectors\n",

    "Category theory is very high level abstract of mathematics, that study mathematical structures and their relations. Although it's very abstract, it's high level of generalization thing allowed to describe objects from different scientific field in a unified terms of closed symmetric monoidal categories. Namely analogies can be shown between physics, topology, logic and computation (Baez and Stay 2011). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of ability to naturally describe quantum mechanics in terms of monoidal categories, there are attempts to introduce to quantum physicists society diagrammatic language for describing quantum circuits (Coecke 2008; 2005). It is argued, that the formalism currently used in quantum mechanics is very suboptimal, since simple identical transformations of the phenomenon recorded by this formalism can be completely non-obvious and indistinct. While with the help of diagrams it becomes clear and obvious.\n",

    "There are many publications using ZX-calculus. They are collected at this website https://zxcalculus.com/publications.html .

    "\n",
    "Any circuit can be represented with ZX-calculus, but at the same time general 'spider' doesn't have a physical representation or analog in common circuit language. So not any ZX-circuit is represented by some normal circuit. This gives additional freedom, which helps in circuit optimization task.\n",
    "Also as there are only few basic elements in ZX-calculus (in contrast to many different redundant circuit gates) number of rules for transforming ZX-calculus circuits is less than 10, which also very convenient for automated circuits optimization. \n",
    "It is claimed by Bob Coecke that because of simplicity of these set of rules, people should be learned ZX-calculus instead of regular gates. But because of simplicity of base elements of zx calculus, lot's of spiders can be required to construct a simple practically useful gate. For computer it is not a problem, but for human being it is inconvenient and provokes mistakes.\n",

    "And furthermore, due to linearity of quantum operators this embedding can be evaluated in parallel for all subgraphs. \n",
    "This is called the quantum oracle and this technic is widely used in famous quantum algorithms. In Shor algorithm quantum parallelism is used to raise the same number in multiple powers encoded in superposition to get superposition of the results.\n",

    "# Generative models\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point of using quantum models for generative tasks was done by two articles published together (Dallaire-Demers and Killoran 2018) more practical and (Lloyd and Weedbrook 2018) more theoretical one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authors claimed that quantum models may have an exponential advantage over classical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This advantage comes from the fact, that measuring quantum system produces a random sample from exponentially big Hilbert Space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These have more theoretical importance than practical, because sampling itself is rarely used in quantum machine learning. Most approaches (see for example [pennylane demos](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations/quantum-machine-learning) ) utilize expectation values of output over each qubit. On the one hand expectation value approach doesn't fully explore the potential of quantum computer. For example it fully ignores quantum correlations over different qubits. But on the other hand this approach is more practical. \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate probabilities of each outcome on real quantum computer, you need exponentially many samples (to keep statistical error $1/\\sqrt{n}$ constant with exponentially increasing number of outcomes). At the same time this makes expectation value more noise resistent, which is vital property in NISQ era. Outcomes themselves are only finite set, while in many practical tasks continuous model prediction (like expectation value) is required.\n",
    "And another significant benefit of expectation value is differentiability. There is a parameter shift technic that replaces infinitely small difference in gradient definition with constant difference. So parameter shift technic makes gradient estimation base on medium number of samples averaging possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these difficulties, there are several attempts to demonstrate any quantum advantage with generative models on practical tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Molecules generation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the attempts is done in QuMolGAN paper (Li, Topaloglu, and Ghosh 2021). Authors took classical GAN model for generating molecules MolGAN (N. De Cao, De Cao, and Kipf 2018), and inserted small (2-4 qubit) quantum circuit in the beginning of the generator. After the quantum circuit goes normal classical layers. That's why authors call their model Quantum GAN with hybrid generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authors conclude, that their quantum model is more efficient, than classical one. And quantum model can be reduced to only 15% of parameters to show performance comparable with results of nonreduced classical model. \n",
    "\n",
    "During training stage Fréchet distance was measured (see figure below)\n",
    "\n",

    "authors plot with learning of quantum and classical GANs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By dint of code, provided by author, we reproduced model learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, proper results visualization shows, that there is no significant advantage of quantum model over comparable classical counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of Fréchet distance Quantum Mean Reduced (MR) model shows even worse performance, than Classical MR model, which can be seen on smoothed plots below\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hacker1337/QML_review/f27334cc67f0675854cfce04df67f6facd5b95de/img/qumolgan_my_plots.png?0 width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, plot of validity score (fraction of valid molecules from generated) shows, that for all models after certain moment there are only vanishingly few number of valid molecules.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In QuMolGAN quantum part was used as a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), which means, that expectation values were used as a quantum circuit output. In such configuration output is fully determined by parameters of PQC (angles of qubit rotations). To get any randomness, required for generative model, part of the parameters were replaced with random numbers. In this sense, model work pretty like classical GANs, that just transform input distribution to some distribution similar to target one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another worth mentioning technic, used in this paper is patching of quantum circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate random vector of specific size with quantum circuit, this vector is divided into $k$ equal parts. And each part is generated separately with small quantum circuits. This approach gives less expressive, as it is a strong restriction to possible circuits width, and size of used Hilbert space is rather small. But it can be necessary in circumstances of NISQ era with quantum devices strongly limited in number of physical qubits, and with classical simulators limited with number of achievable qubits to simulate. With constant device requirement this technic increases dimensionality of output to values closer to practically applicable. \n",

Not expectation values, like in many other works. 5 qubits was used, one of which is ancillary, and 4 output qubits. This gives $2^4=16$ output values. Ancillary qubit gives additional nonlinearity for measured output. As mentioned above, this increases required number of measurements (authors used 3000 samples). But it exponentially increases dimensionality of output data and better unleashes potential of quantum computer.\n",

    "## Compressed images generation\n",
    "\n",

    "### Model architecture\n",
    "In some sense this model is the most quantum among discussed here. It doesn't use classical random noise as an input, but uses quantum random. But they use quantum random in quite specific way.\n",
    "For $n$ dimensional compression $n$ qubit circuit is used. Instead of estimating expectation value over qubits by averaging hight number(~1000) of samples, they average medium (20-30) number of samples. So to certain extend this produces expectation value with significant statistical uncertainty. This results in some distribution. In corner case of 1 sample procedure will result in discrete probability distribution over single measurement outcome ($2^n$ series of \"0\" and \"1\"). Corner case of averaging over $\\inf$ samples results in one real number from [0, 1] over each of $n$ dimensions. \n",
    "Something in between with $m$ samples will result in discrete distribution(binomial distribution) over $m+1$ equally spaced values over each dimension. As it is an averaging of the samples from constant distribution, according to central limit theorem it approaches normal distribution quite fast. \n",
    "This means, that such models won't be able to approximate any complicated distribution far from unimodel \"normal like\" distribution. And furthermore width of distribution (mathematically speaking \"dispersion\") is mostly determined by number of samples. And number as far as it is integer it can't be learned efficiently with gradient decent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discriminator architecture is also worth mentioning. Discriminator is quantum and represented by another PQC. Discriminator produces $n$ qubits state vector and accesses generator prediction via dot product in Hilbert space. Dot product value is used as a loss function of discriminator and generator. \n",
    "Real data samples are fed to discriminator in the same way after encoding to quantum state. They are encoded by simple single qubit rotations so that expectation values over qubits are equal to true values of data sample.   \n",
