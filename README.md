# Quantum Machine learning in NISQ era

In this repo presented several algorithms for quantum computers that have a hope for achieving advantage over classical models at least in some tasks in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era or in nearest future.

1. **QML frameworks**  
  Firstly tools for running quantum algorithms by simulation or by real quantum computers. Frameworks' abilities and limitations are presented.
1. **Continuous Variable Quantum Computing**  
  Foundations of photonic approach to quantum computing with infinite dimensional qumodes instead of 2-dim qubits. 
2. **Generative models**
   - **Quantum Recurrent Unit on Gaussian platform**  
   Continuous variable based algorithm used for text translation.
   - **Quantum GAN-s**  
   Algorithms with widely believed exponential advantage over classical counterparts.   
3. **Category theory and ZX-calculus**     
    Mathematically justified diagrammatic language for writing quantum circuits
4. **Quantum Graph classification models**  
Exponential advantage due to parallel processing of subgraphs. And natural quantum graph embedding based on number of perfect matchings in subgraphs.
